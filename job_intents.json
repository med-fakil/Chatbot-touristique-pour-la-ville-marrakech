No appointment necessary.\n\n3- Take pictures with snakes: you will find snake charmers with their cobras and pythons at different places in the square. The charmers are said to have inherited a gift to be able to approach these reptiles, they are protected by Baraka, a type of divine blessing. On the Jemaâ el Fna square, they offer the spectator a bewitching show.\n\n4 - You can have dinner: at 6pm, a large part of the square starts to transform into a large open-air food court with picnic tables. Vendors vying for your attention from numbered booths. Choose from many offerings, from kebabs and salads, to mutton heads and snails.\n\n5- Entertainment: In the evening, the square turns into a theater, you'll find hundreds of Moroccans listening to storytellers, telling \"halka\" tales, playing games (involving challenges of strength or hand-eye coordination), listening to musicians, or watching transvestite dancers.
